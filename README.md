README refactor 



```classification```

consist of pytorch-lightning and hydra based like pipeline. 
Properly defined pipeline will provide smooth training process, 
dataset agnostic (config makes the things done)


```rust-inference``` 

concept, maybe well want to use rust like backend so with little effort 
we can use some rust-tract with models converted to .onnx format


``` rust-rest-api```

rest api with file transfer and data storage functionalities (copied from some other repo)
